# project1-WilliamHerman
In this project I made use of python, flask, API's, fly.io, and two different websites.
The API's in question are https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/ , and https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php .
with these Im able to retrieve the names, tagline, genere, poster path image, and wiki url page link for each movie when they appear.
I still cant deploy the fly.oi and my VS code cant find the requirments.txt.
